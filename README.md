All routines are implemented purely in C `(C23)` as static functions in headers inside `./include/`.    

------------

Tests use Google's `GoogleTest 1.15.2` (included in `./tests/googletest/`) and require a C++ compiler with `C++20` support. 
Tests for routines in the `C` headers are implemented in the `C++` source files with the same name in the `./tests/` directory.
Media files (`bronze.jpg`, `mobydick.txt`, `plato.txt`, `sqlite3.dll` & `synth.bin`) used for testing are located in the `./media/` directory.
The text files are ebooks downloaded from `Project Guttenberg`.
