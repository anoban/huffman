#### _Significant portion of the code is inspired/improvised from `Mastering Algorithms with C (1999) Kyle Loudon`._

- All routines are implemented purely in C `(C23)` as static functions in headers inside `/include/`.    

- Testing uses Google's `GoogleTest 1.15.2` (included in `/tests/googletest/`), hence requires a C++ compiler, ideally one with support for `C++14` or modern standards.
