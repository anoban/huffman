#### _Significant portion of the code is inspired/improvised from `Mastering Algorithms with C (1999) Kyle Loudon`._

_All routines are implemented purely in C `(C23)` as static functions in headers inside `./include/`._
_Testing uses Google's `gtest`, hence requires a C++ compiler, ideally one with support for `C++20` or modern standards,
older standards may work but I didn't check!_
